          We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore
          where
          <span>
            the design works well and where it can be improved. We focus our
            process
          </span>
          around one central question: “What can we do to make this design more
          <span> efficient?”</span>

          <h5>A picture is worth a thousand words</h5>
          <p>
            Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you
            what
            <span>
              can be improved but also make revamps to the most critical parts
              of
            </span>
            the design.
          </p>
          <h5>Design Report</h5>
          <p>
            We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and
            <span>
              provide a detailed visual report with useful tips and design
              hacks.</span
            >
            This would be the starting point for further work on the design.
          </p>
          <h5>Ways to Redesign</h5>
          <p>
            We provide several strategies for further redesign by various
            <span>
              contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide
              you</span

            with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign
            <span> and quick but effective improvements.</span>
